# Open Source GitHub Pages CDN
An extensive *archive* of popular *and less popular* open source projects.

http://viewsource.github.com

## Why?
This is a community driven resource. So unlike the "big" CDNs we can can add those little projects you love... and when we add a project we take the time to *properly* archive it as far back as possible; jquery v1.0.0 anyone?

## When?
Personally when I'm prototyping a demo on http://jsbin.com or http://jsfiddle.net and I need to pull in some common library or resource then these URLs are just dead simple to remember...

http://viewsource.github.com/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.js

## Small & Fast
GitHub Pages assets are gzip'ed... which can compress the response by as high as 70%!

**Response Headers**

## Use GitHub for file browsing the CDN
If you go to http://viewsource.github.com/jquery it will redirect you to GitHub to see what versions we've got archived for jQuery in the CDN.

If you navigate down to a specific file e.g. jQuery 1.6.2 at  https://github.com/viewsource/viewsource.github.com/blob/gh-pages/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.js then simply remove `https://github.com/viewsource/` and `/blob/gh-pages` from the URL and click Enter/Return then BAM you've got http://viewsource.github.com/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.js
 
Alternatively you will see at the end of the `viewsource.github.com / jquery / 1.6.2 / jquery.js` breadcumb path there is a little "copy to clipboard" icon. This will copy `jquery/1.6.2/jquery.js` to your clipboard... simply paste that onto the end of `http://viewsource.github.com/` and you've got your url.

## Consistent and predictable versioning
We "normalize" the version numbers and remove them from the filenames e.g. `jquery-1.6.js` is archived under `/jquery/1.6.0/jquery.js` - notice the extra `.0` in our folder, this makes switching between versions simple:

http://viewsource.github.com/jquery/1.5.2/jquery.js  
http://viewsource.github.com/jquery/1.6.0/jquery.js  
http://viewsource.github.com/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.js  
http://viewsource.github.com/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.js  

## Dynamic "lastest" versions
A dynamic "latest" version is supported for when you want to test against whatever the most recently released version is in the archive.

http://viewsource.github.com/jquery/latest/jquery.js

## Host your own!
Simply fork this project to host your own GitHub Pages CDN. You will need to fork and then do a commit and push to GitHub before they will setup your GitHub Pages hosting.

Here's my personal fork...
http://chrisjacob.github.com/viewsource.github.com/jquery/latest/jquery.js

**Tip:** the repository only has a `gh-pages` branch; there is no additional `master` branch. So you only need to do `git push` when pushing to GitHub... which is much easier to type then `git push origin gh-pages`.
